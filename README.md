Welcome to our repository showcasing a visually appealing and highly efficient user authentication system! This project aims to provide a seamless sign-in and sign-up experience while incorporating advanced features like password recovery and facial recognition for enhanced security.


In our iOS app, we have, also,  implemented a user profile feature that allows users to edit their profile name and password. This feature provides flexibility and control for users to update their personal information as needed.

Efficient Task Management for Team Collaboration

Welcome to our GitHub repository showcasing our iOS app designed to simplify team collaboration and task management. With our user-friendly interface, you can easily access the groups you're assigned to and view your team's tasks.

For managers, we've included powerful features for efficient team oversight. Managers can quickly track their teams' progress by checking the status of each group's tasks. A percentage indicator shows the overall completion status, including completed tasks.

In addition, managers can assign tasks to team members and set deadlines, ensuring a smooth workflow and accountability. These tools empower managers to effectively manage and optimize their team's performance.

Employees can update task statuses by marking them as "doing" or "done," providing real-time updates on their progress. They can also add Git links to track their work seamlessly.

To enhance organization and productivity, our app offers convenient task filtering options. Users can choose to view "all tasks" for an overview or filter tasks based on status, such as "to do," "doing," or "done." This feature helps users focus on specific tasks and streamline their workflow.

Join us in experiencing the power of efficient task management and seamless team collaboration. Explore our repository and discover how our iOS app can revolutionize your team's productivity and success.
